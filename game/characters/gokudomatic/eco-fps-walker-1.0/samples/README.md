# Demos & Samples

* Demo 1 : Simple case of a bot walking to a given target.
* Demo 2 : Example of multiple bots walking through a map made with an external 3D editor. Also features the static walk speed property, with bots of different speeds.
* Demo 3 : Same example as Demo 2 but with a Navigation node and a navmesh. Paths are now calculated with a path finding algorithm.
* Demo 4 : Example of simple bot killing a target.
* Demo 5 : Example of a guard bot scanning for a group of targets and kill each of them. Also features animated mesh for the bot.
* Demo 6 : Demo of the difference between a bot with path finding and a bot without path finding. Usage of a gridmap/tileset with navmesh and collision.
* Demo 7 : Demo of a bot going through a complicated path  (gridmap) with path finding. The bot uses the dynamic speed feature.
* Demo 8 : Example of a patroling bot. When it detects a target, it switch in attack mode until the target is destroyed. Then the bot returns to its patrol.
* Demo 9 : Demo of a basic FPS game. A patroling bot like in Demo 8 but where the target is the player. Features also the target acquisition on sight (not through walls).
