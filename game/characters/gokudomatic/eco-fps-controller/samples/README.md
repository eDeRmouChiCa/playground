# Samples

Here are regrouped a couple of samples that help to understand how the eco-fps-controller works and how to customize it.

- `1_hello_world` is the hello world for this component. It's just the controller within a custom world. There's also a moving platform that shows how to make lifts.
- `2_basic_weapon` shows a very rudimentary usage of the weapon system. It features a pistol with a mesh and a reload system. Also, instead of demo 1, the world is an imported mesh.
- `3_sounds` features sound effects and how to add them to the controller.
- `4_interaction` features interactions between the controller and other objects.
- `5_hud` displays an HUD and a weapon selection system.
- `6_impact_effects` features impact effects, ignition and explosions.
- `7_custom_weapon` shows how to make your own custom weapon (BFG-9000).
